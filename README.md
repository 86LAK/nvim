# 86LAK's Neovim Config

After exploring kickstarter and NvChad I have returned back to kickstarter :). 
This config takes inspiration from kickstarter, NvChad, LazyVim and probably a few others.
## Todo
- [ ] change theme to aether
- [ ]  move all plugins that I added from root to custom plugins. follow structure the stuff in lua/kickstart/plugins do where they return the requriements``]
